Chapter 1 - Bark
There was an injured dog that went by the name of Pickles. 
He lived a happy life, at least, until the Great Accident of 2003. 
His former family treated Pickles with the utmost love and care, but when the Accident took over the town, Pickles was left to wander the streets on his own. 
For the past couple of years, Pickles had been walking around the street, feeling cold and alone. 
That is, until he came upon a musician named Earl. 
Earl was a kind, old man who played street music, but he, too, was often ignored by people. 
Pickles was on the search for food where he bumped into Earl. 
Pickles flinched from the sudden touch of another being, but as soon as Pickles looked up at the man, all he saw was pure kindness. 
Earl leaned down and petted the shivering dog, providing Pickles the unfamiliar experience of feeling warmth. 
Pickles leaned into the old man's warm touch, and Earl felt a certain part of his soul that was originally void of feeling to one that transformed into a feeling of pure happiness. 
Considering Pickles's very small size, Earl decided to pick Pickles up and wrap his coat around him, causing Pickles to stop shivering. 
Pickles began to feel sleepy, and Earl decided to continue with his performance, serenading the poor dog. 
Pickles was finally able to sleep peacefully after so many years of being alone.
