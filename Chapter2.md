Pickles brought joy into Earl's life. 
They travled the streets of the city together, playing on intersection corners, entertaining locals and tourists alike, steadily gaining cash and coin as they charmed their way into the hearts of the people.
Earl's steady guitar and Pickles' happy yips were soon staples within the bustling atmosphere of the city.
People stopped to watch on their lunch breaks, lingering long enough for a song or two, always leaving just a little bit happier.
They had their ups and downs, but toghether, Earl and Pickles were making their way in the big city.
