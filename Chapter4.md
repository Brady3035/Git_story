Pickles sat down on his haunches, a look of defeat on his face. 
Even after four long days of scrounging for food, nothing was found. 
The ribs were showing through pickles' fur, and a growl from deep inside of his stomache echoed hauntingly throughout the alleyway atmosphere, solemnly reminding him of his past few foodless days. 
Suddenly, just as pickles was about to submit to his hunger and accept the dark reality of his situation, he heard a sound.
A sound that was different, not at all like the increasingly aggressive growls coming from his gut. 
No, this sound was beautiful, a blessing to the ears. 
This was music.
The notes floated through the air and were recieved by Pickles' auditorial drums leading his ears to jutt upwards. 
A newfound energy seemed to flow through Pickles as it seemed the calm and almost sweet melody seeped through his body.
It felt to Pickles as though his stomach had been filled by the music and he was able to get back up on all four legs, even though his paws were now covered in cuts and bruises.
Pain didn't matter.
Pickles, finally giving into his curiosity, started to creep towards the sound, slowly increasing his pace as his confidence grew.
After a few seconds of walking, Pickles rounded the corner exiting the alleyway and was met with a beautiful sight.
In front of him was a man, and in front of this man was a piano. 
The man's hands flew across the keys as elegantly as a classical dancer would move during performance. 
Pickles, still unable to bark due to his hunger, let out a loud "bork" and the man suddenly stopped playing the piano.
"HOly crap dawg lets make some beats togehter my name is Earl!"
The end i got bored.
